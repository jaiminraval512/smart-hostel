day : 1 

Today, I checked how a hostel management system website usually looks. After that, I created a logo for my website. Then I made the folder structure according to the internship requirements.

After that, I created the header and footer for the hostel management system. I added the logo and some quick links in the header and applied CSS to it. I also designed the footer using CSS. Finally, I included both the header and footer files in the index.php file so they appear on the home page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day :2
Yesterday, I completed the header and footer. Today, I designed the sidebar. In the sidebar, I added options like Home, Student, Student Registration Form, Rooms, Student Attendance, Fees, and Logout.

Today, I only created these options. I will create all the pages later and also add more options to the sidebar in the future.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day :3 

Today, I created the user login system for my Smart Hostel (Hostel Management System).

First, I created the login structure using HTML. After that, I went to phpMyAdmin and created a database named Hostel Management System. Then, inside the database, I created a table named users. In this table, I added fields such as user_id, user name, email, mobile number, and password.

After that, I connected the login and register files with the database. Then, I designed both the login and register pages using CSS.

Finally, I created a logout file, added the logout query, and linked the logout option to the logout file so that the user can log out properly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day :4

Yesterday, I completed the login page and registration page. Today, I started working on the home page. First, I created a hero section on the home page and added an image to it. From this section, when a student clicks on the Book Now button, it will open the hostel registration page, which I will create later.

Below the hero section, I created a features section and added six cards to it.

Today, I worked only on these parts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day : 5 

Yesterday, I had completed only half of the home page. Today, I continued working on it and developed it further.

Since all the sections were coming together, I created a separate div between the sections to maintain proper spacing and separation.

After that, I designed all the content properly, added box shadows around the boxes, and improved the website to make it more user-friendly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day : 6

Today, I worked on improving the existing project based on the work completed in the previous days. I made small changes in the folder structure and organized the files properly. I also updated some sections of the home page to improve spacing and alignment. Along with this, I made minor design changes in the header, sidebar, and content area to make the layout more clean and user-friendly. These small improvements helped make the website look better and more structured.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day :7 

Today, I created a student registration form that allows students to take admission in the hostel.

I connected this form with the database so that the data can be stored properly. The form was connected to the database because, in the future, an admin panel will be developed to manage all student records easily.

At present, I have only created the form. Tomorrow, I will add a file upload feature so that students can upload their documents.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day : 8

Yesterday, I created the student registration form. Today, I added document upload options to the form. I included options to upload a passport-size photo, Aadhar card, school/college bonafide certificate, and the previous year’s marksheet. I also made all these document uploads mandatory.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day : 9

Today, I continued working on the student registration page that I had started earlier. I added a Terms and Conditions section at the bottom of the page. Then, I added JavaScript to the submit button so that the submit button appears and the form can be submitted only when the student accepts all the terms and conditions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day : 10

Today, I worked on the student admission form page. I fixed the alignment of the page and arranged all the input fields properly. After that, I added a reset button next to the submit button so that the form can be reset when needed.

After completing these changes, I designed the page using CSS to improve its overall look and layout.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day: 11 date : 15-jan

Earlier, I had created the student registration form. Today, I started working on the weekly food menu page for the hostel.

First, I prepared the menu based on my own planning. After that, I created the complete menu in a table format.

Then, I fixed the alignment of the entire page and designed the table properly. In the table header, I divided it into four parts: Day, Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. In the table body, I used table rows to add all the days and their respective menus.

Today, I completed the page using only HTML. Tomorrow, I will design it using CSS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day 12 : 16 jan 

Yesterday, I had created the weekly food menu page and written it using HTML. Today, I designed the same page using CSS. I applied different background colors to the table header and table body to clearly separate them. I also styled the day column with a different color so that it stands out from the rest of the menu.

In addition to this, I added hover effects using CSS transform properties to improve the user experience and make the table more interactive. These styling changes helped make the weekly menu page more attractive, organized, and easy to read.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day 13 : 17 jan 


Yesterday, I had created the weekly mess menu table. Today, I added a new section below the table.

First, I added the meal timings so that users can easily check the breakfast, lunch, and dinner schedule. This helps students understand the daily food timings clearly.

Below the timings section, I added the food-related terms and conditions to inform students about the rules and guidelines for mess usage. These additions make the page more informative and helpful for users.

Overall, this new section improves clarity and provides complete information along with the weekly mess menu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day 14 : 19 jan
Today, I designed a loader for my website. First, I added the loader code in HTML just after the body tag. After that, I styled the loader using CSS to give it a proper design and animation.

Then, I wrote the logic for the loader using JavaScript. In the logic, I used an event listener so that the loader runs automatically whenever the page loads. This ensures that the loader is displayed while the page content is loading and provides a better user experience.

Overall, this feature improves the look of the website and makes the loading process smoother for users.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day 15 : 20 jan 
Today, I slowly started working on the admin panel. First, I checked and studied how the design and structure of an admin panel usually look. After that, I started creating the sidebar for the admin panel.

As I continue creating different pages for the website, I will also manage and control all those pages through the admin panel.
